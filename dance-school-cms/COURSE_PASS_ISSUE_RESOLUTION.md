# Course Pass Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Multiple customers bought 2 course and 3 course passes but the passes didn't show in their active accounts, despite successful payments.

**Date Investigated**: September 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Root cause identified and fixed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Results
1. **Comprehensive System Scan**: Found **17 users without subscriptions** since September 1st, 2025
2. **Pass Configuration**: All course passes (2, 3, 4 course) are properly configured and functional
3. **Webhook Processing**: The webhook system was receiving events but **failing silently** during subscription creation
4. **Database Issues**: Users were being created successfully, but subscription creation was failing

### Specific Case Analysis: hh-aaber@online.no
- **Customer**: hh-aaber@online.no
- **Purchase Date**: September 14, 2025
- **Pass Purchased**: 2 Course Pass (2290 NOK)
- **Payment Status**: ✅ Successful
- **Issue**: User existed in database but no subscription was created
- **Resolution**: ✅ Manually created subscription - now shows as active

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. **Silent Webhook Failures**
- Webhooks were processing but failing during subscription creation
- No proper error logging or alerting system
- Failed subscriptions were not being tracked or retried

#### 2. **Pass Configuration Edge Cases**
- Some passes had expired fixed dates causing immediate failures
- Missing validation for pass configuration before processing
- No fallback mechanisms for configuration issues

#### 3. **Database Transaction Issues**
- User creation succeeded but subscription creation failed
- No atomic transactions ensuring both operations succeed together
- Missing error handling for partial failures

## Solution Implemented
