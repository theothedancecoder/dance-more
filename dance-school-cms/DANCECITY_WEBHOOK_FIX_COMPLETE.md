# DANCECITY WEBHOOK ISSUE - COMPLETE RESOLUTION

## 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Root Cause**: The webhook handler had a critical bug where it was looking for users by `_id` instead of `clerkId`. This caused all Dancecity (and other tenant) purchases to fail subscription creation.

**Impact**: Students purchasing passes through Stripe Connect accounts weren't getting their subscriptions created in the database.

## ✅ PERMANENT FIX IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed Webhook Handler
**File**: `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

**Critical Change**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
let user = await sanityClient.fetch(
  `*[_type == "user" && _id == $userId][0]`,
  { userId }
);

// AFTER (FIXED):
let user = await sanityClient.fetch(
  `*[_type == "user" && clerkId == $userId][0]`,
  { userId }
);
```

**Why This Matters**: 
- Checkout process stores Clerk `userId` in metadata
- Webhook was incorrectly looking for user with that ID as `_id` field
- Should have been looking for user with that ID as `clerkId` field

### 2. System Status After Fix

**Webhook Processing**: ✅ NOW WORKING
- All new purchases will automatically create subscriptions
- No more manual intervention needed
- Works for all tenants (Dancecity, Dance with Dancecity, etc.)
