# Clerk SignUp Infinite Redirect Loop Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing an infinite redirect loop during the student sign-up process for tenant-specific routes. The logs showed URLs progressively getting longer with nested `/verify-email-address/` paths:

```
/dance-with-dancecity/sign-up/SignUp_clerk_catchall_check_*
/dance-with-dancecity/sign-up/verify-email-address/SignUp_clerk_catchall_check_*
/dance-with-dancecity/sign-up/verify-email-address/verify-email-address/SignUp_clerk_catchall_check_*
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the **Clerk SignUp and SignIn component configurations** across all authentication pages. The components were missing critical routing configuration properties that tell Clerk how to handle routing properly within the Next.js app router structure.

**Missing Configuration:**
- `routing="path"` - Tells Clerk to use Next.js routing instead of creating its own routes
- `path` - Explicitly defines the route path for the component
- `afterSignUpUrl` / `afterSignInUrl` - Controls where users go after successful authentication
- `redirectUrl` - Provides explicit redirect control

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/app/[slug]/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`** - Tenant-specific sign-up
2. **`src/app/[slug]/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`** - Tenant-specific sign-in  
3. **`src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`** - Global sign-up
4. **`src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`** - Global sign-in

### Changes Applied:

#### Tenant-Specific Pages:
```tsx
// Before
<SignUp 
  fallbackRedirectUrl={`/${tenantSlug}`}
  signInUrl={`/${tenantSlug}/sign-in`}
/>

// After
<SignUp 
  routing="path"
  path={`/${tenantSlug}/sign-up`}
  fallbackRedirectUrl={`/${tenantSlug}`}
  afterSignUpUrl={`/${tenantSlug}`}
  signInUrl={`/${tenantSlug}/sign-in`}
  redirectUrl={`/${tenantSlug}`}
/>
```

#### Global Pages:
```tsx
// Before
<SignUp />

// After
<SignUp 
  routing="path"
  path="/sign-up"
  fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"
  afterSignUpUrl="/dashboard"
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  redirectUrl="/dashboard"
/>
```

## Key Configuration Properties

- **`routing="path"`**: Forces Clerk to use Next.js routing instead of hash-based routing
- **`path`**: Explicitly defines the route path, preventing Clerk from creating nested routes
- **`afterSignUpUrl`**: Controls where users are redirected after successful sign-up
- **`redirectUrl`**: Provides fallback redirect URL for various authentication flows
- **`fallbackRedirectUrl`**: Backup redirect when other redirects fail

## Expected Results

1. **No more infinite redirect loops** during sign-up/sign-in processes
2. **Proper email verification flow** without nested URL paths
3. **Consistent routing behavior** across tenant-specific and global authentication
4. **Improved user experience** with predictable redirect behavior

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test student sign-up flow for tenant `dance-with-dancecity`
2. Verify email verification process works correctly
3. Test both tenant-specific and global authentication flows
4. Confirm proper redirects after successful authentication
