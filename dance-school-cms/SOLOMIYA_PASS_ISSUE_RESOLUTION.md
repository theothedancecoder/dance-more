# Solomiya Pass Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
**User**: –°–æ–ª–æ–º—ñ—è –ú–µ—Ä–≤'—è–∫ (Solomiya Merviak)  
**Email**: miiamer88@gmail.com  
**Problem**: User reports not seeing her active passes in the frontend interface  

## Investigation Results

### ‚úÖ Backend Status: WORKING CORRECTLY
- **User exists** in Sanity database with correct Clerk ID: `user_2zYHmsOLHH3hj5cH93XnEfdYkVJ`
- **2 active subscriptions** exist and are properly configured:
  1. **Open week Trial Pass (multi)** - Valid until 2025-08-18, 10 classes remaining
  2. **Open week Trial Pass (clipcard)** - Valid until 2025-09-10, 10 classes remaining
- **API query works perfectly** - returns both subscriptions correctly
- **Data integrity is perfect** - all tenant references and dates are correct

### üîç Root Cause: FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION ISSUE
The API endpoint test revealed:
- Server responds correctly with 401 Unauthorized when not authenticated
- Clerk auth headers show: `'x-clerk-auth-status': 'signed-out'`
- This indicates the user's browser session may be corrupted or expired

### For Developers

The backend is working perfectly. The issue is in the frontend authentication flow. Possible causes:

1. **Clerk session corruption** - User's authentication token is invalid/expired
2. **Browser cache issues** - Old cached data interfering with API calls
3. **CORS/Network issues** - API calls being blocked by browser security
4. **Frontend rendering bug** - Data received but not displayed properly
