## 🚀 **ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION**

**Will future purchases from other students show in their accounts?**

### Monitoring Tools Created:
1. `diagnose-specific-user.mjs` - For investigating individual user issues
2. `sync-all-missing-subscriptions.mjs` - For catching any missed subscriptions
3. `check-webhook-requirements.mjs` - For verifying system health

## 📋 **Action Items for You**

### Immediate (Next 24 hours):
1. ✅ **Confirm with student** (`kruczku@pm.me`) that their pass is now visible
2. ✅ **Test with a small purchase** to verify the complete flow works
3. ✅ **Monitor next few purchases** to ensure they appear automatically

### Ongoing Monitoring:
1. **Weekly Check**: Run `sync-all-missing-subscriptions.mjs` weekly to catch any edge cases
2. **Customer Support**: If students report missing passes, use the diagnostic scripts
3. **System Health**: Monitor webhook delivery success in Stripe Dashboard

## 🔍 **How to Handle Future Issues**

1. **Quick Fix** (2 minutes):
   ```bash
   cd dance-school-cms
