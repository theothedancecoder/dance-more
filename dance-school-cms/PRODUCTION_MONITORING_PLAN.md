# Production Monitoring & Maintenance Plan

## 🚨 PRODUCTION CRITICAL ACTIONS

### Immediate Production Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ **Fixed 2 missing customer subscriptions** (kruczku@pm.me, mollergata9@gmail.com)
2. ✅ **Verified all recent purchases** have corresponding subscriptions
3. ✅ **Created production-ready diagnostic tools** for quick resolution

## 📊 PRODUCTION MONITORING SCHEDULE

### Daily (Automated - 5 minutes):
```bash
# Check for any missing subscriptions from last 24 hours
cd dance-school-cms
node create-missing-subscription.mjs
```
**When to run**: Every morning at 9 AM
**Expected result**: "No missing subscriptions found" or automatic fixes applied

### Weekly (Manual - 10 minutes):
```bash
# Comprehensive sync of all recent transactions
cd dance-school-cms
node sync-all-missing-subscriptions.mjs
```
**When to run**: Every Monday morning
**Expected result**: Catch any edge cases missed by daily checks

### Monthly (Manual - 15 minutes):
```bash
# Full system health check
cd dance-school-cms
node check-webhook-requirements.mjs
node diagnose-webhook-issue.mjs
```
**When to run**: First Monday of each month
**Purpose**: Verify webhook configuration and environment health

## 🔧 PRODUCTION INCIDENT RESPONSE

### Customer Reports Missing Pass (Response Time: <5 minutes):

**Step 1** (30 seconds): Quick automated fix
```bash
cd dance-school-cms
node create-missing-subscription.mjs
```

**Step 2** (2 minutes): If no recent purchase found, check specific customer
```bash
# Edit diagnose-specific-user.mjs with customer email first
node diagnose-specific-user.mjs
```

**Step 3** (2 minutes): Manual subscription creation if needed
```bash
# Edit create-subscription-for-user.mjs with customer details
node create-subscription-for-user.mjs
```

### Escalation Path:
- **Level 1**: Automated scripts (95% of cases)
- **Level 2**: Manual investigation using diagnostic tools
- **Level 3**: Direct database intervention (rare)

## 📈 PRODUCTION METRICS TO MONITOR

### Success Metrics:
- **Webhook Success Rate**: Target >98%
- **Customer Complaints**: Target <1 per week
- **Resolution Time**: Target <5 minutes
- **False Positives**: Target <5%

### Warning Signs:
- Multiple missing subscription reports in one day
- Webhook endpoint returning errors
- Stripe Connect account access issues
- Environment variable changes

## 🛡️ PRODUCTION SAFEGUARDS
