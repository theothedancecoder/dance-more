# Stripe Webhook Signature Verification Fix

## Problem
The Stripe webhook endpoint `/api/stripe/webhook` was failing with the error:
```
Webhook Error: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload. 
Are you passing the raw request body you received from Stripe?
```

This was causing webhook delivery failures for events like `charge.succeeded`.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect body parsing**: The original implementation used `req.arrayBuffer()` and converted to string, which could corrupt the raw body needed for signature verification
2. **Missing event support**: The webhook only handled `checkout.session.completed` events, but Stripe was sending `charge.succeeded` events
3. **Insufficient error handling**: Limited debugging information when signature verification failed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Signature Verification
**Before:**
```typescript
const body = await req.arrayBuffer();
const bodyString = Buffer.from(body).toString('utf8');
event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(bodyString, sig, webhookSecret!);
```

**After:**
```typescript
body = await req.text();
event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret);
```

**Why this works:**
- `req.text()` preserves the exact raw body as received from Stripe
- No encoding/decoding that could alter the bytes used for signature calculation
- Direct string handling eliminates buffer conversion issues

### 2. Added Support for Additional Events
Now handles:
- ✅ `checkout.session.completed` (existing)
- ✅ `charge.succeeded` (new)
- ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded` (new)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added webhook secret validation at startup
- Improved error logging with detailed debugging information
- Better error messages for troubleshooting

### 4. Improved Event Processing
- Added `handleChargeSucceeded()` function to process charge events
- Enhanced compatibility with payment intents that have metadata
- Better handling of customer details in mock sessions

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Main webhook handler

## Testing
Created `test-webhook-signature-fix.mjs` to verify:
- ✅ Webhook secret configuration
- ✅ Signature verification logic
- ✅ Event construction and parsing

## Key Improvements

### Security
- Proper signature verification prevents webhook spoofing
- Validates webhook secret exists before processing

### Reliability
- Handles multiple Stripe event types
- Better error recovery and logging
- Prevents webhook delivery failures

### Maintainability
- Clear event handling structure
- Comprehensive error messages
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Deployment Checklist
- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] Local testing completed
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor Stripe webhook dashboard for successful deliveries
- [ ] Check application logs for proper event processing

## Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
1. **Stripe Dashboard** → Webhooks → Endpoint → Recent deliveries
2. **Application logs** for successful event processing
3. **Database** for new subscriptions being created from webhook events

## Event Flow
```
Stripe Event (charge.succeeded) 
    ↓
Webhook Endpoint (/api/stripe/webhook)
    ↓
Signature Verification (✅ Fixed)
    ↓
Event Type Routing
    ↓
handleChargeSucceeded() → createSubscriptionFromSession()
    ↓
Subscription Created in Sanity
```

## Success Metrics
- Webhook delivery success rate: Should be 100%
- No more "signature verification failed" errors
- Successful subscription creation from charge.succeeded events
- Proper handling of NOK 250.00 charges (as mentioned in original error)
