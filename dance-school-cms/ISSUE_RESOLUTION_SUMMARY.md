# Issue Resolution Summary: Missing Pass for kruczku@pm.me

## Issue Description
Student with email `kruczku@pm.me` purchased an "Open week Trial Pass" (250 NOK, 10 classes) but it wasn't showing in their account at the Dancecity dance school.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **Stripe API Access Problem**: The current Stripe API key doesn't have access to the Connect account `acct_1RudFvL8HTHT1SQN`
2. **Webhook Failure**: The automatic subscription creation via webhook didn't work
3. **User Status**: User had "pending" role which might affect access

### System Architecture:
- **Payment Flow**: Stripe Checkout → Webhook → Sanity Subscription Creation
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Sync API that checks recent Stripe sessions
- **User Management**: Clerk authentication + Sanity user storage

## Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: User Verification
- ✅ User exists in Sanity: `oLHtOefD7nkFljdU8KWMC8`
- ✅ Email: `kruczku@pm.me`

### Step 2: Tenant Verification
- ✅ Tenant found: Dancecity (`sOY5WwoEBY24iuIm0CkYss`)
- ✅ Stripe Connect Account: `acct_1RudFvL8HTHT1SQN`

1. Day Drop In (unlimited) - 400 NOK

3. 4 Course Pass (subscription) - 3200 NOK
