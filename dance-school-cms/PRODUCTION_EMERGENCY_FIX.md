# 🚨 PRODUCTION EMERGENCY FIX - August 11, 2025

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: Multiple customers reporting missing passes from production site
**Root Cause**: Duplicate webhook endpoints causing webhook delivery conflicts
**Impact**: Intermittent subscription creation failures

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED

### Fixed Missing Subscriptions:
1. **kruczku@pm.me** - "Open week Trial Pass" (10 classes)
2. **mollergata9@gmail.com** - "kizomba drop in" (1 class) 
3. **mollergata9@gmail.com** - "DAY DROP-IN" (unlimited access)

### Current Status:
- ✅ **ALL recent purchases now have subscriptions**
- ✅ **0 missing subscriptions found in system-wide sync**
- ✅ **Emergency fix scripts working correctly**

## 🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Webhook Configuration Issues:
1. **Duplicate Endpoints**: 2 webhook endpoints pointing to same URL
   - Endpoint 1: 4 events (created 8/9/2025 12:26:03 AM)
   - Endpoint 2: 6 events (created 8/9/2025 12:21:26 AM)
2. **Delivery Conflicts**: Multiple endpoints causing race conditions
3. **Missing Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` not set

## 🚀 PRODUCTION SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Emergency Response System
**30-Second Fix** for any reported missing pass:
```bash
cd dance-school-cms
node create-missing-subscription.mjs

cd dance-school-cms
node sync-all-missing-subscriptions.mjs
```

3. **Add missing environment variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://www.dancemore.app`
4. **Test webhook delivery** after cleanup
